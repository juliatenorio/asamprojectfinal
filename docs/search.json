    "section": "Introduction - Julia Aceron, Pomona College, 2028",
    "text": "Introduction - Julia Aceron, Pomona College, 2028\nAs an inspiration to this archive of visual documents and interview transcripts, it began at the beginning of this class, ASAM135 Race Empire Filipinx America. From one of the early articles, “The Mis-education of the Filipino” by Vintage Constantino, I was interested in some of the themes about how the United States had distorted cultural history and heavily influenced education in the Philippines. Later on during class, I began to wonder more about my mom’s experience of growing up in the Philippines and how her education there shaped her views. \nReferring back to the Constantino article, some highlighted themes that I was interested in were how education centered around the colonial mentality, economic dependence, and how English was the main language of instruction. During my interview with my mom, the questions I asked mainly dealt with her experience with her school’s resources (or the lack thereof) and her views on American influence on education in the Philippines. \nHistorically, the colonization of the Philippines by the United States paved the way for their heavy influence on education. According to Rick Baldoz’ book, Third Asiatic Invasion, the “Americanization” program was executed for the purpose of spreading westernized values to the Philippines. Political and economic systems in the Philippines were parallel to that of the United States, which also paved their way to the educational bureaucracy in the Philippines. \nTowards a more personal experience, Carlos Bulosan’s book, On Becoming Filipino, highlighted the struggles of Filipinos when it came to achieving citizenship. One of the main pathways to citizenship was education. From one of his short stories, he illustrated the goals of his cousin, Consorcio, which were to get a good education and become an American citizen. While this particular story focused on getting an education in the United States, I was interested in Consorcio’s trajectory towards his dream, and how American education affected his journey. Throughout the story, Consorcio invested in academic books and was motivated to pursue education. However, as time went on, he slowly realized that despite him going to school, learning English, and adapting to American values, he couldn’t become a citizen. Eventually, as American policies changed, he got his citizenship status, but lost his Filipino culture and roots along the way. \nAs a result of reading about American education and how the Philippine education system was impacted by American imperialism, I wanted to learn more about my family and their personal experiences in post-secondary education in the Philippines. After interviewing with my mom, I realized that these themes were heavily aligned with her experience. For instance, the economics classes that my mom took in the Philippines were mainly in English. The classes that were in Tagalog were only the Tagalog-based classes, but there were significantly more classes that were taught in English. Another thing to note is that some classes were taught in “Taglish”, which is a mixture between Tagalog and English. When I interviewed my tita, she emphasized that her classes were taught ONLY in English. Despite both my mom and tita going to school in the Philippines, it was interesting to see how the level of affluence in different areas influenced the way education was taught. \nAfter conducting these interviews with my mom and tita, I believe that the education in the Philippines is overall heavily influenced by the U.S. system, especially through the classes that are being offered and the language of instruction. A particular part of this process that was interesting for me to find out was how U.S. influence was considered a “privilege”, since lower socioeconomic areas in the Philippines were less “Americanized”. My mom mentioned how her school had limited resources and career development, and Tagalog was still somewhat implemented in her school. On the other hand, my tita mentioned how her school had strong connections to companies, and English was the only language of instruction with the exception of some Tagalog-only literature classes. These trends definitely parallel the goals of the U.S., where they want higher institutions in the Philippines to focus more on westernized education. \nThrough this website, I have included interview transcripts and provided photo libraries for both my mom and tita. Their photo archives highlight their experience with education in the Philippines, and I hope to emphasize the influence of their education on their current everyday lives."

My interview with my dad explores his perspective on transnationalism, multi-stage migration, and the ways these movements shaped his own trajectory of immigration and identity. His story provides an intergenerational lens on how migration has shaped our family, revealing how broader systems of labor, empire, and colonialism intersect with personal histories. Through this project, I hope to piece together a narrative of my family’s immigration, one that reflects the layered realities of Filipinx people in the diaspora."

    "text": "What did your “day in a life” experience look like when you went to college in the Philippines?\nI was an everyday, average student who took public transportation. I lived in a nearby suburb in Manila. For transportation, I would take a tricycle ride to the service road, then I’d go via jeepney to a main transportation hub, and then take another jeepney to a bigger transportation hub, and from there I’d take the light-rail (which was like a Philippine metro system)l to my school’s station. The roads weren’t planned out well; they were small even though there was a dense population of Filipinos. I didn’t have the privilege to have a car or a driver. To make my 8:00am class, I would have to leave at 5:30am from my house. Sometimes I would miss the first class due to driver strikes or other situations. As for school itself, my university was on a trimester system. The college made sure that students were only in school for half a day, so either they had all morning classes or all afternoon classes. Since I took computer science, sometimes I’d stay for labs or group projects."

During my first-year, I would take the basic computer science classes, then I would choose my specialization after. Currently, they split the major into three categories: computer engineering, computer science, and computer information systems. Back then, it was only one major. Some core subjects I focused on were computer programming, data-based design, neural networks (AI), elective in usability, computer interaction, graphic design, and computer puppetry/animation."

    "text": "Was there any type of academic counseling/advising in the Philippines? If so, what did that look like? If not, how did you navigate your academics?\nThe student cohort was grouped into sections, and each class was given a section advisor. During the first year, some students didn’t know much about specializations, so they consulted their professors about these things. I knew that I wanted to get into software technology because I liked the front-end of computer programming, so I didn’t really utilize that resource. There was also a dean that students could go to. Overall, we didn’t navigate academics because everything was pre-selected by the college. Since the university tried to have students take classes for only half a day, each class would switch from the morning to the afternoon between each trimester. This encouraged students to not drop out or fail, or else they would have to stay for longer than half a day. I wish that there was more flexibility with this though because sometimes the professors would not be good, but I didn’t want to redo the class the following trimester since I would have to stay there longer. Some students even flunked out due to their mixed schedules."

In the U.S., there were a lot more classes to take. I didn’t have a lot of time in the Philippines to take classes outside my major. In the U.S., some students can take classes on a whim without worrying about finishing their major. I also didn’t have time for extracurriculars due to the school’s rigor. During my PE class, I would play ping pong and even went against my professor. He asked me to join the ping pong team, but I told him that I didn’t have the time for it. When I said I was a computer science major, he immediately understood. \nThere was also a difference in resources. At the time, the internet was hard to access and I had to manually download images for them to show up. My school used the “Vax System”. There was also more respect towards authorities and professors; we’d often call them sir or ma’am. When students misbehaved, sometimes the professor would put down his chalk and say, “If you’re going to waste your parents’money, it’s up to you”. There was also no housing at my university because of the lack of money and resources. Professors would also announce grades in front of the school. They would say who got a 3.0 GPA, 3.5 GPA, or a 4.0 GPA."

I started college at 16 years old. However, now the Philippines is starting the K-12 system, inspired by that in the United States. The more affluent specific areas are, the more they follow the U.S. structure. So, in the more rural, provincial areas, there was less U.S. influence."

Maybe the trade schools would have internships. At La Salle, they had companies for students to intern at. Since they were a more wealthy institution, they had better connections. I got an internship at the United Coconut Planter’s Bank (UCPD). For the top schools, they wanted to maintain a standard for their graduates. They would train us to develop resumes, dress professionally, and do mock interviews. They motivated us to participate in these because we’d level up with our own professional presentation. The quality of resumes was so good that companies could identify a “La Salle” resume."

Most students left the Philippines after graduating school. Some of my peers now live in Canada, Singapore, U.S., etc. A lot of Filipinos left abroad because there aren’t a lot of quality job opportunities in the Philippines. I learned to appreciate the luxuries we have here; most countries don’t have the modern amenities. \nOn another note, there’s no student loans in the Philippines. There’s financial assistance, but the institution was mainly supported through donations. In 1999, 30,000 pesos a month translates to roughly $1,000-$2,000 here, which was considered a large amount there."

Humanities, math, economics, etc. were taught in English. However, mostly there was a mix of Tagalog and English (Taglish). One of the Filipino classes that I took was Filipino 101, which was a class based on reading and writing compositions. The Tagalog in that class is really deep."

    "text": "Oral History - Shirley Rodil\nBorn in Lipa City, Batangas, as the oldest of seven siblings, she grew up with significant responsibilities in a low-income family. Her early life was marked by hardship: studying by gas lamp, fetching water at dawn, and helping her mother sell fruits and grind palay (unhusked rice). \nAfter high school, she became a saleslady and medical secretary to support her family and eventually moved to Manila on her own for work. She later met my grandfather, and together they began their family. In 1982, my grandfather migrated to Saudi Arabia as a financial controller for an oil company through a recruitment agency, marking the beginning of their family’s participation in the overseas labor economy. A few years later, my grandmother followed with my father and aunt, working as a medical clerk in a hospital. \nShe described the ten years spent in Saudi Arabia as both financially necessary and emotionally difficult. When the family eventually returned to the Philippines, they faced limited opportunities, prompting her to fulfill a childhood dream of migrating to the United States. There, she worked as a caregiver (1999–2008) and later pursued massage therapy, graduating in 2011 and continuing to send remittances to her family in the Philippines."

    "text": "Oral History - Mark Rodil\nHe grew up in the Philippines largely separated from his father, who worked overseas for much of his childhood. He recalled feeling fearful and unfamiliar with his father each time he returned home, an experience that speaks to the emotional dislocation produced by labor migration.\nWhen the family reunited in Saudi Arabia, my father attended an international school, but the 1991 Gulf War forced them to return to the Philippines. This historical moment situates his childhood within the global context of U.S. military intervention and the geopolitics of oil and labor in the Gulf. In States of Exclusion: Migrant Work in the Gulf Arab States by Adam Hanieh, he states that the Gulf’s development of skyscrapers, real estate booms, and mega-projects were built largely on the exploitation of temporary migrant labour, imported from South and Southeast Asia. Labor migration to the gulf is a structural component of a global political economy: Gulf states import cheap, highly vulnerable labour to sustain their economies, while sending countries export surplus labor. Later, he joined his parents in the U.S. and attended college in the Philippines before eventually immigrating himself."

What were the lived realities of Filipina overseas workers and their families? How do care work and gender shape the migration trajectories of Filipina workers to the U.S.? How do OFWs’ remittances and transnational family structures influence their later migration pathways? What factors led Filipino workers to fully migrate out of the Philippines and into the United States?"
