If so, what did that look like? If not, how did you navigate your academics?</h2>
<p>I went to a public school, so there were limited resources. I didn’t have license or guidance counselors, so we had to rely on the teachers instead for counseling. In the province, there isn’t a lot of choices, so the classes that I took were pre-selected by the school. </p>

<p>More freedom in the U.S. in choosing classes; Take less classes; had 6 classes everyday as opposed to 1-3 classes; In the Philippines, they teach more practical skills in high school; How to sew, home economics, make crafts with wood Involved building with hands; Teach students how to set up the table for formal events, how to dress up during interviews etc.; Teach students about different cultures (Chinese, Japanese, Spanish, American, etc.); Memorization centered; The teacher rotates; The teacher goes to a different classroom when students transition from class to class; Classrooms have a main advisor for the entire class → relates to counseling; Wore uniforms from elementary to college</p>

<p>Side note: transcript mentioned U.S. and State of California</p>
<p>When I immigrated to the U.S., I had to have my transcript evaluated so the units can transfer over. Some of the aspects of the school that seemed influenced by the U.S. were the grading system and the English classes. English was the main language of instruction in college. A more recent development was the K-12 system, but during my time there was only elementary and high school. </p>
<p>Aside: Accreditation is when the school is recognized for high status with academics. It needs to meet certain standards for education quality.</p>

<p>I had to do independent research on career development. In other schools, there’s healthcare, IT, vocational centers, etc. There were also internships, but I found and applied to those on my own. </p>

<p>It depends on the class. Humanities, math, economics, etc. were taught in English. However, mostly there was a mix of Tagalog and English (Taglish). One of the Filipino classes that I took was Filipino 101, which was a class based on reading and writing compositions. The Tagalog in that class is really deep. </p>
