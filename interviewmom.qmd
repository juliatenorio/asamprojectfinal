## Interview Transcript 

## What is your name? Where did you go? What are you doing now? 

My name is Liza Aceron, and I went to a Public college in Riza. Now, I am a substitute teacher at Rowland Unified School District in the U.S.. \n 

## What did your “day in a life” experience look like when you went to college in the Philippines? 

I commuted to school by taking public transportation, and I had 6 classes a day. \n 

## What did you study in the Philippines? What are some subjects you focused on? 

I majored in management and had a focus on business administration. \n 

## Was there any type of academic counseling/advising in the Philippines? If so, what did that look like? If not, how did you navigate your academics?

I went to a public school, so there were limited resources. I didn't have license or guidance counselors, so we had to rely on the teachers instead for counseling. In the province, there isn't a lot of choices, so the classes that I took were pre-selected by the school. \n 

## What are some main similarities/differences between the education in the Philippines (as a student) and the education in the U.S. (as an educator in high school) 

## Differences 
More freedom in the U.S. in choosing classes;
Take less classes; had 6 classes everyday as opposed to 1-3 classes;
In the Philippines, they teach more practical skills in high school;
How to sew, home economics, make crafts with wood 
Involved building with hands;
Teach students how to set up the table for formal events, how to dress up during interviews etc.; 
Teach students about different cultures (Chinese, Japanese, Spanish, American, etc.);
Memorization centered;
The teacher rotates; 
The teacher goes to a different classroom when students transition from class to class;
Classrooms have a main advisor for the entire class → relates to counseling;
Wore uniforms from elementary to college 

## Similarities 
Grading is the same;
Classes taught in Taglish (Tagalog and English);
In the U.S., ethnic studies came in later;
More critical thinking;
The students rotate \n

## What are some aspects of the Philippine education system that seem influenced by the U.S. education system? 
Side note: transcript mentioned U.S. and State of California 

When I immigrated to the U.S., I had to have my transcript evaluated so the units can transfer over. Some of the aspects of the school that seemed influenced by the U.S. were the grading system and the English classes. English was the main language of instruction in college. A more recent development was the K-12 system, but during my time there was only elementary and high school. \n

Aside: Accreditation is when the school is recognized for high status with academics. It needs to meet certain standards for education quality.\n 

## Were there opportunities for career development for Filipino students in the Philippines? 

I had to do independent research on career development. In other schools, there's healthcare, IT, vocational centers, etc. There were also internships, but I found and applied to those on my own.  \n

## Were the classes mainly taught in English, Tagalog, or another Filipino language? What classes were taught in English? In Tagalog? 

It depends on the class. Humanities, math, economics, etc. were taught in English. However, mostly there was a mix of Tagalog and English (Taglish). One of the Filipino classes that I took was Filipino 101, which was a class based on reading and writing compositions. The Tagalog in that class is really deep.  \n 

## What was it like to balance family responsibilities and school? 

It was really difficult because I was a working student. I didn't have time to join other clubs and organizations because I had to take care of my family. I also had to commute, and there were specific times for transportation.  \n 

## Is there anything else that you would like to add on about your experience? 

School is from 7am-5/6pm
