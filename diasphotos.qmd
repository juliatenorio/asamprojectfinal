Figure 23. Quote from Dia: "One of many all-nighters for our thesis. It was the last thing we had to complete to graduate because every group, but one, decided to drop the thesis course and enroll in it alone the following trimester. It delayed our graduation date, but helped ensure we had time to complete it and hopefully pass."
