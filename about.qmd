Project Proposal: Conduct an interview with an individual(s) that has had experience with having a post-secondary education in the Philippines and create a website that demonstrates family history and roots. \n   

Key Questions: 
What is the impact on the education in the Philippines with U.S. influences? 
What are the main goals of having the U.S. oversee Filipino education? 
How accessible is education for Filipino families of different socioeconomic backgrounds? What kind of educational systems are there in the Philippines? 
How does having education in the Philippines affect views/perspectives on the U.S. once people immigrate there? \n

## Introduction - Alessi Rodil

Kamusta! My name is Alessi Rodil, and my project centers on Filipinx overseas workers and the labor system influences FIlipinx migration. 

## Project Layout

Topic: The transnational influences of the overseas labor-export system on Filipinx migration. 

Project Proposal: Create a digital photo archive and conduct an oral interview with my grandmother, Shirley Rodil, and my father, Mark Rodil to piece together my grandmother’s early life in the Philippines and the factors that led her family to migrate to Saudi Arabia, return to the Philippines, and eventually come to the United States.

Key Questions: What are the factors (systemic and personal) that drove Filipinx workers to find means of living outside their homeland? What were the lived realities of Filipina overseas workers and their families? How do care work and gender shape the migration trajectories of Filipina workers to the U.S.? How do OFWs’ remittances and transnational family structures influence their later migration pathways? What factors led Filipino workers to fully migrate out of the Philippines and into the United States?
