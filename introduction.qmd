## Introduction - Julia Aceron, Pomona College, 2028 

As an inspiration to this archive of visual documents and interview transcripts, it began at the beginning of this class, ASAM135 Race Empire Filipinx America. From one of the early articles, "The Mis-education of the Filipino" by Vintage Constantino, I was interested in some of the themes about how the United States had distorted cultural history and heavily influenced education in the Philippines. Later on during class, I began to wonder more about my mom's experience of growing up in the Philippines and how her education there shaped her views. \n 

Referring back to the Constantino article, some highlighted themes that I was interested in were how education centered around the colonial mentality, economic dependence, and how English was the main language of instruction. During my interview with my mom, the questions I asked mainly dealt with her experience with her school's resources (or the lack thereof) and her views on American influence on education in the Philippines. \n 

## Introduction - Alessi Rodil, Pomona College, 2028

Through these interviews, I was able to piece together my grandmother’s early life in the Philippines and the factors that led her family to migrate to Saudi Arabia, return to the Philippines, and eventually come to the United States, all while my father grew up caught between these places.\n 

I want to examine how Filipinx overseas workers, especially my grandparents, experience migration as a multi-stage process: beginning with temporary labor migration in the Middle East and eventually transitioning into long-term or family-based migration to the United States. My interview with my dad explores his perspective on transnationalism, multi-stage migration, and the ways these movements shaped his own trajectory of immigration and identity. His story provides an intergenerational lens on how migration has shaped our family, revealing how broader systems of labor, empire, and colonialism intersect with personal histories.
Through this project, I hope to piece together a narrative of my family’s immigration, one that reflects the layered realities of Filipinx people in the diaspora.
