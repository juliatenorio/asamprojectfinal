What were the lived realities of Filipina overseas workers and their families? How do care work and gender shape the migration trajectories of Filipina workers to the U.S.? How do OFWs’ remittances and transnational family structures influence their later migration pathways? What factors led Filipino workers to fully migrate out of the Philippines and into the United States?"
