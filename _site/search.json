What were the lived realities of Filipina overseas workers and their families? How do care work and gender shape the migration trajectories of Filipina workers to the U.S.? How do OFWs’ remittances and transnational family structures influence their later migration pathways?

    "text": "Oral History - Shirley Rodil\nBorn in Lipa City, Batangas, as the oldest of seven siblings, she grew up with significant responsibilities in a low-income family. Her early life was marked by hardship: studying by gas lamp, fetching water at dawn, and helping her mother sell fruits and grind palay (unhusked rice). \nAfter high school, she became a saleslady and medical secretary to support her family and eventually moved to Manila on her own for work. She later met my grandfather, and together they began their family. In 1982, my grandfather migrated to Saudi Arabia as a financial controller for an oil company through a recruitment agency, marking the beginning of their family’s participation in the overseas labor economy. A few years later, my grandmother followed with my father and aunt, working as a medical clerk in a hospital. \nShe described the ten years spent in Saudi Arabia as both financially necessary and emotionally difficult. When the family eventually returned to the Philippines, they faced limited opportunities, prompting her to fulfill a childhood dream of migrating to the United States. There, she worked as a caregiver (1999–2008) and later pursued massage therapy, graduating in 2011 and continuing to send remittances to her family in the Philippines."

He recalled feeling fearful and unfamiliar with his father each time he returned home, an experience that speaks to the emotional dislocation produced by labor migration.\nWhen the family reunited in Saudi Arabia, my father attended an international school, but the 1991 Gulf War forced them to return to the Philippines. This historical moment situates his childhood within the global context of U.S. military intervention and the geopolitics of oil and labor in the Gulf. In States of Exclusion: Migrant Work in the Gulf Arab States by Adam Hanieh, he states that the Gulf’s development of skyscrapers, real estate booms, and mega-projects were built largely on the exploitation of temporary migrant labour, imported from South and Southeast Asia. Labor migration to the gulf is a structural component of a global political economy: Gulf states import cheap, highly vulnerable labour to sustain their economies, while sending countries export surplus labor. Later, he joined his parents in the U.S. and attended college in the Philippines before eventually immigrating himself."

From one of the early articles, “The Mis-education of the Filipino” by Vintage Constantino, I was interested in some of the themes about how the United States had distorted cultural history and heavily influenced education in the Philippines. Later on during class, I began to wonder more about my mom’s experience of growing up in the Philippines and how her education there shaped her views. \nReferring back to the Constantino article, some highlighted themes that I was interested in were how education centered around the colonial mentality, economic dependence, and how English was the main language of instruction. During my interview with my mom, the questions I asked mainly dealt with her experience with her school’s resources (or the lack thereof) and her views on American influence on education in the Philippines."

My interview with my dad explores his perspective on transnationalism, multi-stage migration, and the ways these movements shaped his own trajectory of immigration and identity. His story provides an intergenerational lens on how migration has shaped our family, revealing how broader systems of labor, empire, and colonialism intersect with personal histories. Through this project, I hope to piece together a narrative of my family’s immigration, one that reflects the layered realities of Filipinx people in the diaspora."
